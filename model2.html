 <p size='40'>The Cupertino-based tech giant launched four 12 series iPhones last year - iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max.<br>
    And, according to a report from Counterpoint Research's â€˜Market Pulse' Three iPhone 12 series smartphones (12, 12 Pro, and 12 Pro Max) have contributed to 71 percent of Apple's total sales for the month of January<br> 
    as the tech giant grabbed six places in the global top 10 best-selling smartphones list.<br>
    The Apple iPhone 12 led the list followed by the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max. <br>
